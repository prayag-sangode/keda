# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) vs Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA):

| Feature / Capability                   | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)                            | Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)                   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scaling Metrics**                    | CPU, memory utilization                                      | CPU, memory, custom metrics, external events                 |
| **Trigger Types**                      | Resource utilization (CPU, memory)                          | Custom metrics, external triggers (e.g., queue length)       |
| **Support for Custom Metrics**         | Requires custom metrics API or adapters                     | Built-in support for various external and custom metrics     |
| **Event-Driven Scaling**               | Not supported                                                | Supported (e.g., Kafka lag, RabbitMQ queue length)           |
| **Integration with External Systems**  | Limited (requires custom development or third-party tools)  | Built-in support for various external systems and APIs       |
| **Scaling Logic**                      | Basic (target average utilization, replica count)            | Advanced (multi-metric scaling, custom scaling policies)     |
| **Scaling Based on Business Metrics**  | Challenging without custom development                      | Supported with direct integration and configuration         |
| **Dynamic Metric Fetching**            | Not supported                                                | Supported (fetch metrics dynamically from external sources)  |
| **Fallback Mechanisms**                | Limited support                                              | Supported (e.g., fallback to minimum replicas on failure)    |
| **Cooldown Period**                    | Basic support                                                | Advanced configuration (stabilization window, cooldown)     |
| **Scaling Flexibility**                | Limited to Kubernetes-native metrics                        | Extensive (integrates with various monitoring systems)       |
| **Use Cases**                          | Standard resource-based autoscaling                         | Complex scaling scenarios, event-driven architectures        |
| **Community Support**                  | Widely adopted, good community support                       | Growing adoption, expanding feature set                      |
| **Deployment and Configuration**       | Standard Kubernetes deployment                              | Additional components (e.g., adapters, custom controllers)   |
